# eddyvinck/sapper-graphql-template

Based on the default [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template (Rollup).

## What is this template for?

I made this template so I can use it to scaffold projects easily with `degit`. I'm sharing it because it might be of use to other developers as well.

It allows you to use GraphQL with Svelte. It supports server side rendering as well.

üê¶ Please follow me on Twitter: [@veinq](https://twitter.com/Veinq_)\_ for updates. I also post a lot about a lot of web development related things that might interest you.

Thanks for checking it out!

### What's included?

- [`svelte-apollo`](https://github.com/timhall/svelte-apollo)
- [`apollo-server-express`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-express)
- GraphQL Playground: go to http://localhost:3000/graphql.
- MongoDB used with [`mongoose`](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- Configuration with [`config`](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) configuration files in `/config/`
- Authentication via GraphQL (directives) based on JWT

## Getting started

### Using `degit`

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository. Use either the `rollup` or `webpack` branch in `sapper-template`:

```bash
npx degit eddyvinck/sapper-graphql-template my-app
```

### Running the project

First, you need to start MongoDB on your local machine. On Linux, I [run the `mongod` command](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/) in my terminal to do that, but you might prefer another way. I recommend [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) if you want to explore the data in the database directly.

You can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
cd my-app
yarn # or npm install
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

After running `yarn dev` your database should be populated with some sample data. This data is coming from the script in `src/server/db/utils/createSampleData.js`, in case you're interested, and will only run if it can't find the sample data and if you are in development mode. You can comment the function out in `src/server.js` if you don't want this.

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around (or a different port if you configured a different one). If you can see the blog posts on [localhost:3000/blog](http://localhost:3000/blog) then everything is working correctly.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.

## Structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project ‚Äî `src` and `static`.

### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app ‚Äî `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` ‚Äî along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.

#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes ‚Äî _pages_, and _server routes_.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)

**Server routes** are modules written in `.js` files, that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods. Each function receives Express `request` and `response` objects as arguments, plus a `next` function. This is useful for creating a JSON API, for example.

There are three simple rules for naming the files that define your routes:

- A file called `src/routes/about.svelte` corresponds to the `/about` route. A file called `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` corresponds to the `/blog/:slug` route, in which case `params.slug` is available to the route
- The file `src/routes/index.svelte` (or `src/routes/index.js`) corresponds to the root of your app. `src/routes/about/index.svelte` is treated the same as `src/routes/about.svelte`.
- Files and directories with a leading underscore do _not_ create routes. This allows you to colocate helper modules and components with the routes that depend on them ‚Äî for example you could have a file called `src/routes/_helpers/datetime.js` and it would _not_ create a `/_helpers/datetime` route

### static

The [static](static) directory contains any static assets that should be available. These are served using [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).

In your [service-worker.js](src/service-worker.js) file, you can import these as `files` from the generated manifest...

```js
import { files } from "@sapper/service-worker";
```

...so that you can cache them (though you can choose not to, for example if you don't want to cache very large files).

## Bundler config

Sapper uses Rollup or webpack to provide code-splitting and dynamic imports, as well as compiling your Svelte components. With webpack, it also provides hot module reloading. As long as you don't do anything daft, you can edit the configuration files to add whatever plugins you'd like.

## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. As an example, to deploy to [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) when using `sapper export`, run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g now
now
```

If your app can't be exported to a static site, you can use the [now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper) builder. You can find instructions on how to do so in its [README](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper#basic-usage).

## Using external components

When using Svelte components installed from npm, such as [@sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list), Svelte needs the original component source (rather than any precompiled JavaScript that ships with the component). This allows the component to be rendered server-side, and also keeps your client-side app smaller.

Because of that, it's essential that the bundler doesn't treat the package as an _external dependency_. You can either modify the `external` option under `server` in [rollup.config.js](rollup.config.js) or the `externals` option in [webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js), or simply install the package to `devDependencies` rather than `dependencies`, which will cause it to get bundled (and therefore compiled) with your app:

```bash
npm install -D @sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list
```

## Bugs and feedback

Sapper is in early development, and may have the odd rough edge here and there. Please be vocal over on the [Sapper issue tracker](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues).
